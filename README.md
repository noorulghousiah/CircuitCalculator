# CircuitCalculator
This is a group project made by our team:
Noorul Ghousiah;
Adibatunnisa';
Adlin Johana;
Nurul Aqiella.

This is a calculator for circuit analysis so that the value of currents or voltages of a particular  circuit can be determined precisely.
It is specifically built to analyse DC circuit with independent sources and linear resistors

This application is developed for engineers and electrical personnel to analyse circuits using nodal 
and mesh analysis. Electrical students can also use this application to enhance their understanding 
of electric circuits. The application is easy to use and give an accurate answers.
